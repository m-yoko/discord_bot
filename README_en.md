## Note: Look carefully at the license file for that branch.

## What is this?

* It is an open source discord bot using Java.
* Use it carefully and at your own risk, as the license changes over time.
* The license will be applied to the branch.
* If you want to add features, please set up an Issue and I will add them if I find them interesting.
* I will also fix bugs when I feel like it.
* Pull requests are also welcome.
* The source for this bot is public, but if you want private, one-off, or special features, please contact me and I will consider them.
* If you want to use it for commercial purposes, please contact us for a separate license.
* If you want other functions, we'll implement them, but music bots require more resources (CPU, memory, and network bandwidth), so their priority is low.
